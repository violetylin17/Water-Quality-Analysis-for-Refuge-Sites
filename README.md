# 🌊 Water Quality Analysis at Refuge Sites (1994–2005)

## 📊 Dataset Overview

Water quality data collected biweekly from 1994 to 2005 by volunteers at designated locations within the Refuge. Measurements include:

- **pH**
- **Dissolved Oxygen (DO)** (mg/L)
- **Salinity** (parts per trillion)

Sampling sites:

- The Bay  
- D-Pool *(fishing pond)*  
- C-Pool  
- B-Pool  
- A-Pool

## 🔠 Variables

**Categorical Variables:**

- `Site`: The Bay, D-Pool, C-Pool, B-Pool, A-Pool  
- `Year`: 1994–2005

**Quantitative Variables:**

- `Salinity` (ppt)  
- `Dissolved Oxygen (DO)` (mg/L)  
- `pH` (standard units)

## ❓ Research Questions

- How do **pH**, **Salinity**, **Water Temperature**, and **DO** change across refuge sites from 1994 to 2005?
- Are there significant fluctuations that may impact aquatic vegetation and organisms?
- Do water quality metrics remain within **DEQ regulations** over time?

## 🧪 Tentative Plan of Action

**Hypotheses:**

- **H₀**: No significant change in water quality year-over-year; aquatic environment is sustained.  
- **H₁**: Significant fluctuations in variables indicate contamination risk.

**Techniques:**

- F-statistics  
- ANOVA  
- Regression analysis
